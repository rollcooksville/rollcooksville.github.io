PingStreet - Reporting Infrastructure Issues
********************************************

The city of Mississauga utilizes the `PingStreet app <https://www.mississauga.ca/portal/services/pingstreet>`_ for citizens to report issues they see within the city.  Using this app you can report potholes, faded line marking, debris in the roadway, etc.  To utilize this reporting app you'll be asked for the nearest road address.  From there it is best to include a picture of the issue and a description of where the issue is relative to the location provide.  Once you submit your issue you'll be provided with a service request number that can be used to track status of your issue.   

If you notice anything that is an immediate safety issue it should be reported to 3-1-1 to have the city deal with in immediately.

ROAD WATCH - Reporting Dangerous and Aggressive Drivers
*******************************************************

Peel Police run the `ROAD WATCH program <https://www.brampton.ca/EN/residents/Roads/pedestrian-driver-safety/Pages/road-watch-program.aspxwhere>`_. ROAD WATCH is a community initiative that gives residents and visitors an opportunity to report dangerous and aggressive drivers to the police.

Police will review the citizen report and contact the plate owner with the details of the reported incident and may pursue further action if necessary.

You will remain anonymous unless you choose to pursue a detailed police investigation that may result in charges being laid and require a court appearance.

The online reporting system is used to report many things, so you don't need to fill in all details being requested.  The forms will ask you to provide employer information and drivers licence number, but these are not required in order to submit a ROAD WATCH report.
