Hi everyone, we're a new organization in the Cooksville neighbourhood that wants to encourage folks to consider travelling by bike for short trips.  A lot of Mississauga is actually within 5km of the 5 & 10 intersection in Cooksville (Hurontario and Dundas).  City Centre and Port Credit are visitable from within a 5km journey which would take 15-30 minutes depending on the typical pace most people can casually cycle (10-20km/hr pace).  Plus it is just fun to explore the neighbourhood by bike.
