:summary: Combining bikes and transit can drastically increase increase the ground you can cover with your bike and your bike can be complimentary to transit service.

Did you know that you can increase the range you can travel with your bike by combining it with rack and roll programs on buses.  You can rack your bike on the front of MiWay and GO busses. This can allow you to bike to more frequent express routes to take advantage of the frequency and distance covered by these routes.  You can use your bike on either end of the trip to travel short distances where there may be no bus service present or the bike can free you from the timing of the local routes.

You are also allowed to bring any type of bike on GO trains outside of rush hour periods.  Folding bikes have an exception and are allowed on GO trains during rush hour periods.  On weekends in the summer you can also take advantage of Niagara bound GO trains to explore the Niagara area.  


Don't just take our word for it.  Our friends at CultureLink Sustainable Communities have done a great job walking through transit options that are available in Mississauga within the video below.
